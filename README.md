📝 Overview

The Botswana Health Indicators Dashboard is an interactive analytics tool built with Streamlit that brings together:
	•	Official WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data, and

to help analyze national health outcomes, long-term trends, and public awareness across a wide range of indicators (HIV, TB, maternal health, infant mortality, suicide, adolescent health, and more).

This dashboard supports public health decision-making, research, data storytelling, and health policy communication by combining:
	•	Hard epidemiological data
	•	Real-time public search interest
